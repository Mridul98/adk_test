To identify customers who have placed more than 10 orders, you should query the `CUSTOMER_ORDERS` model. This model aggregates order activity per customer and calculates metrics such as `total_orders`.\n\nHere is the SQL query to retrieve customers with more than 10 orders:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    customer_id,\n    total_orders,\n    total_spent,\n    avg_order_value,\n    last_order_date\nFROM\n    CUSTOMER_ORDERS\nWHERE\n    total_orders > 10;\n```\n\nThis query selects all columns from the `CUSTOMER_ORDERS` model and filters the results to include only those records where the `total_orders` metric is greater than 10. The `CUSTOMER_ORDERS` model is derived from the `STAGING.STG_ORDERS` table, which contains granular transaction details [Data: CUSTOMER_ORDERS (record ids), STAGING.STG_ORDERS (record ids)].\n\nAdditionally, the `COALESCE` function is used in models like `INT_CUSTOMER_METRICS` to replace `NULL` values with 0 for metrics such as `total_orders`. This ensures that the `total_orders` metric is reliably available for filtering [Data: INT_CUSTOMER_METRICS (record ids), COALESCE (record ids)].'
