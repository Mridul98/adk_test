'To determine the trend of closed opportunities over the last four quarters, you would need to count the number of opportunities that entered the "Closed Won" stage for each of those quarters. The `Sales Opportunity Stage Tracking Community` and `Opportunity RSAC Analytics Community` are relevant for this analysis. The `OPPORTUNITY_RSAC_QUARTERLY` model appears to be the most direct source for aggregated quarterly data.\n\nHere is a conceptual SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nWITH QuarterlyClosedOpportunities AS (\n    SELECT\n        STRFTIME(\'%Y-%q\', DATE_ENTERED_STAGE_CLOSED_WON) AS closed_quarter,\n        COUNT(DISTINCT opportunity_id) AS number_of_closed_opportunities -- Assuming an opportunity_id exists\n    FROM\n        your_sales_data_table -- Replace with the actual table containing opportunity stage dates\n    WHERE\n        DATE_ENTERED_STAGE_CLOSED_WON IS NOT NULL\n        AND DATE_ENTERED_STAGE_CLOSED_WON >= DATE(\'now\', \'-4 quarters\') -- Filter for the last four quarters\n    GROUP BY\n        closed_quarter\n)\nSELECT\n    closed_quarter,\n    number_of_closed_opportunities\nFROM\n    QuarterlyClosedOpportunities\nORDER BY\n    closed_quarter;\n```\n\n**Note:** This SQL query is a conceptual representation. The actual table and column names (e.g., `your_sales_data_table`, `opportunity_id`, `DATE_ENTERED_STAGE_CLOSED_WON`) would need to be replaced with the specific names from your dbt models or data warehouse. The `STRFTIME(\'%Y-%q\', ...)` function is common in SQLite and PostgreSQL for formatting dates into year-quarter format; adjust this function based on your specific SQL dialect (e.g., `FORMAT(date, \'yyyy-Q\')` in SQL Server, `TO_CHAR(date, \'YYYY-Q\')` in Oracle).'
