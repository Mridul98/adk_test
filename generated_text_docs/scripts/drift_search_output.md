'To generate a sales report per region for each product, the following data and considerations are relevant based on the provided reports:\n\n### **Key Data Sources**\n1. **Product Sales Data**:\n   - **`staging.stg_orders`** and **`staging.stg_products`** tables (Source 1) contain product identifiers, order dates, and sales metrics (e.g., `net_amount`). These are used to calculate monthly sales totals and product performance [Data: Sources (1)].\n   - **`product_monthly`** model aggregates sales data by product and month but does not include regional information [Data: Reports (4)].\n\n2. **Customer-Region Data**:\n   - **`staging.stg_customers`** (Source 6) includes customer identifiers and region information. This table is processed to standardize fields like `region` (trimmed and capitalized) and is used to compute customer segments (e.g., Platinum, Gold) [Data: Sources (6, 7)].\n   - **`raw.customers`** (Source 7) serves as the foundational source for customer-region data, which is transformed into a tidy format during ETL processes [Data: Sources (7)].\n\n---\n\n### **Required Joins and Transformations**\n- **Join Keys**: \n  - **`customer_id`** in **`staging.stg_customers`** and **`staging.stg_orders`** can link customer-region data with product sales data through orders. However, this join is not explicitly implemented in existing models and would need to be added manually [Data: Sources (1, 6)].\n  \n- **Data Granularity**:\n  - Product sales data is at the product-by-month level, while customer-region data is aggregated by region and customer segment. Aligning these requires careful handling of timeframes and regional scopes [Data: Sources (1, 6)].\n\n---\n\n### **ETL and Data Quality Considerations**\n- **Standardization**: \n  - The ETL process for **`raw.customers`** ensures `region` is trimmed and capitalized, reducing inconsistencies [Data: Sources (7)].\n  - **`staging.stg_orders`** and **`staging.stg_products`** are aggregated to compute metrics like monthly sales totals and growth percentages [Data: Sources (1)].\n\n- **Missing Constraints**:\n  - No explicit ETL constraints or validation rules for regional data in **`stg_customers`** are documented, though data quality checks (e.g., filtering invalid emails) are applied elsewhere [Data: Sources (7)].\n\n---\n\n### **Limitations and Next Steps**\n- **No Direct Joins**: Existing models do not include direct joins between customer-region and product sales data, requiring manual implementation [Data: Sources (1, 6)].\n- **Temporal Metadata**: The datasets lack timestamps or metadata about update intervals, making it impossible to estimate delays between source updates and report generation [Data: Reports (4)].\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nTo generate a sales report per region for each product, you would need to:\n1. Use **`staging.stg_orders`** and **`staging.stg_products`** for product sales data.\n2. Link to **`staging.stg_customers`** for region information via **`customer_id`**.\n3. Implement the join manually, as it is not part of existing models.\n4. Leverage ETL processes to ensure data consistency (e.g., standardizing `region` fields). \n\nThis approach would enable region-specific product sales analysis, though existing models require modification to fully support this use case.'
