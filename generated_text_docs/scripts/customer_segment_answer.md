'Customers are segmented based on the following criteria, as outlined in the data:\n\n1. **Geographic Region**:  \n   The `REGION` entity (Data: 30) is explicitly identified as a key dimension for segmentation. Metrics like average lifetime value (AVG_LTV) and average orders (AVG_ORDERS) are aggregated by region and customer segment [Data: Reports (0); Sources (6, 7)].\n\n2. **Behavioral Metrics (Spending Patterns)**:  \n   The **BASE model** classifies customers into tiers (e.g., Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) using **total_spent thresholds** [Data: Reports (0); Sources (6)]. This is further refined by joining cleaned customer data (with active status) to intermediate metrics tables [Data: Sources (6, 7)].\n\n3. **Data Quality and Engagement Status**:  \n   - The **`is_active` flag** (normalized to `TRUE` if NULL) ensures only valid, active customers are included in segmentation [Data: Sources (7); Reports (0)].  \n   - Emails are filtered to retain only records containing an `@` character, excluding invalid or missing entries [Data: Sources (7)].  \n\n4. **Data Processing and Integrity**:  \n   The **CLEANED_CUSTOMER_MODEL** ensures data consistency by trimming names, normalizing emails, and handling missing values. This processed data is critical for segmentation logic [Data: Sources (6, 7); Reports (0)].  \n\n**Not Mentioned**:  \n- Demographic or psychographic factors (e.g., age, preferences) are not referenced in the data.  \n- Status-based criteria like account activity or churn risk are not explicitly integrated into segmentation models [Data: Reports (0); Sources (6)].  \n\nIn summary, segmentation relies on **geographic, behavioral, and data integrity criteria**, with a strong emphasis on ensuring data quality through preprocessing steps.'
