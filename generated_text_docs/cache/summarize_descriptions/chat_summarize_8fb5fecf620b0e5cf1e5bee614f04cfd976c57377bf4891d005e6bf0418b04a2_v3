The user wants a comprehensive summary of the given data. The entities are \"PRODUCT\" and \"CATEGORY\". The descriptions all mention that Product is associated with Category through the category attribute. The first description is general, the next two specify the tables: raw.products and staging.stg_products.\n\nI need to combine these into one concise description. All three descriptions agree on the main point but differ in the table names. Wait, the first one doesn't mention a table, the others do. So the first is more general, the others are more specific. The user said to include information from all descriptions. So I should mention that the association is via the category attribute, and note that in the raw.products and staging.stg_products tables. Also, the user wants third person and entity names included.\n\nI should check if there's any contradiction. The first description doesn't mention tables, but the others do. However, they all agree on the attribute being \"category\". So the summary should state that the association is through the category attribute, and that this is found in both the raw and staging tables. That way, all information is included without contradiction. Also, the user emphasized enriching with nearby text, but there's no other text provided. So just stick to the given data. Make sure it's third person and includes the entity names.\n"}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 407, "prompt_tokens": 310, "total_tokens": 717, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null}}}
