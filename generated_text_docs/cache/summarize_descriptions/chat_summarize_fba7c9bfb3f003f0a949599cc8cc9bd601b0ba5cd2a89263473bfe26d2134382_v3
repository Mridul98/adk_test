In the **raw** schema, it is primarily captured in the **raw.products** table, which contains attributes such as **product_id**, **product_name**, **category**, **brand**, **price**, and **stock_quantity**. Transformations applied here include trimming and title-casing **product_name** and **category**, converting **brand** to lowercase, casting **price** to **decimal(10,2)**, and replacing null **stock_quantity** values with **0**. Additionally, **product_id** is referenced in the **raw.order_items** table to identify specific items within order lines.  \n\nIn the **staging** layer, the **stg_products** table (both in the **staging** and **public** schemas) serves as a transformed version of the product data. The **staging.stg_products** table includes **product_id**, **category**, and optionally **product_name** (depending on the version), while the **public.stg_products** table further includes **brand** as a metadata attribute. These staging tables act as intermediate storage for cleaned and structured product data, ensuring consistency for downstream processes.  \n\nThe **PRODUCT** entity thus spans from raw source data in **raw.products** through transformation stages in **staging.stg_products** and **public.stg_products**, with attributes evolving from basic identifiers (e.g., **product_id**, **category**) to enriched metadata (e.g., **brand**, **price**, **stock_quantity**) and standardized formatting. This progression reflects the ETL workflow’s role in refining product data for analytical or operational use.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the \"PRODUCT\" entity based on the given descriptions. First, I need to go through each description and note the key points.\n\nThe first description mentions the product_id in raw.order_items, which identifies the item in an order line. Then, the next two talk about raw.products table with attributes like product_id, category, and more details like product_name, brand, price, stock_quantity. Transformations include trimming, title-casing, converting to lowercase, and decimal conversion. \n\nThen there are mentions of staging.stg_products table with varying attributes: some have product_id and category, others add product_name. The last one refers to public.stg_products with product_id, product_name, category, brand.\n\nI need to consolidate all these. The main entity is PRODUCT, represented in different tables across raw and staging layers. The attributes vary, but product_id is common. The transformations are important for the raw.products table. Also, the staging tables have different levels of detail. Need to mention all tables, attributes, transformations, and note that public.stg_products is part of the public schema. Make sure to resolve any contradictions, like different attributes in staging tables. Maybe the staging tables have different versions, so it's important to note that. Also, the purpose of each table: raw for source data, staging for transformed data, public for metadata. Ensure the summary is third person, includes all entities, and is concise.\n"}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 660, "prompt_tokens": 467, "total_tokens": 1127, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null}}}
